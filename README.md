# Cellular_automata

A cellular automata simulation of global warming

# TODOS

# part A CODE

### General

- fix grid items overly wit scrollbar 
# part  B CODE ASSISTED res in PDF

- find by trial and error starting parameters for which the system is stable but not static in the course of a year
- measure the range of parameters in the course of a year print the average and mean error through time
- make a graph that follows the parameters throu the year (fix parameters as written in white paper )

# part C

- check the assumption that pollution affects other parameters in the system
- check correlation between other parameters and pollution
- check sensitivity of the system to pollution by keeping all other values the same while changing pollution

### maybe if there is time

- fix grid wobbling issues

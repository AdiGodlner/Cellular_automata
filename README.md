# Cellular_automata
A cellular automata simulation of global warming 





# TODOS 

### General
- change text to all new cells
- present text in cells in a viewable way 
### cellular automata view 
- canvas rectangles and text return an ID 
  save the canvas instead of creating and deleting rectangles all the time ?
- or maybe use grid ? and labels with ids to change the background color and text based on active board
- should the cellular autommat viewr wrap the class offer all CA ethos 
    but call the CA given to it 
### Wind
- clouds should decrease temperature 
- what should rain do 
### Tiles 
- maybe add temperature to a tile what should be the size of a tile
    how can I fit all the info on one tile
### temperature
 should temperature be based on height 
or even base temp
- better temperature random initialization
